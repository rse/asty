About
-----

ASTY is a Generic Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) library for JavaScript,
i.e., it provides a hierarchical data structure for holding the syntax
abstraction of an arbitrary formal language. It is usually used
in combination with a parser generator like [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/)
to carry the results of the parsing step and to provide the vehicle
for further processing of those results.

Usage
-----

ASTY provides a class for the construction of a single AST node.
The tree of AST nodes is formed by linking child nodes into
a parent node. The class API (in a notation somewhat resembling TypeScript
type definitions) is:

- `new ASTY(type: String, attrs?: {[name: String]: [value: Object]}, childs?: ASTY[]): ASTY`:<br/>
  Create a new ASTY node and optionally already set attributes and add child nodes.

- `ASTY#merge(node: Node, takePos?: Boolean, attrMap?: {[from: String]: [to: (String|null)})): ASTY`:<br/>
  Merge attributes, childs and optionally the position of a node.
  The attributes can be renamed or skipped (if mapped onto `null`).

- `ASTY#type(type: String): Boolean`:<br/>
  `ASTY#type(): String`:<br/>
  Set or get type of node.

- `ASTY#pos(line: Number, column: Number, offset: Number): ASTY`:<br/>
  `ASTY#pos(): Object`:<br/>
  Set or get the position for the node. This is done automatically
  in the function which is generated by `PEGUtil.makeAST`.

- `ASTY#set(name: String, value: Object): ASTY`:<br/>
  Set a single attribute `name` to `value`.

- `ASTY#set({ [name: String]: [value: Object] }): ASTY`:<br/>
  Set multiple attributes, each consisting of name and value pairs.

- `ASTY#get(name: String): Object`:<br/>
  Get value of attribute `name`.

- `ASTY#attrs(): String[]:<br/>
  Get names of all node attributes.

- `ASTY#add(childs: ASTY[]): ASTY`:<br/>
  Add one or more childs to a node. The array `childs`
  can either contain ASTY objects or even arrays
  of ASTY objects.

- `ASTY#del(childs: ASTY[]): ASTY`:<br/>
  Delete one or more childs from a node.

- `ASTY#childs(): ASTY[]`:<br/>
  Get a nodes list of childs.

- `ASTY#walk(callback: (node: ASTY, depth: Number, whenNow: String) => Void, when?: String): ASTY`:<br/>
  Recursively walk the AST starting at this node (at depth 0). For each
  visited node the `callback` function is called with the current node
  and the tree depth. By default (and if `when` is either `before` or
  `both`), the callback is called before(!) all child nodes are visited
  and with `whenNow` set to `before`. If `when` is set to `after` or
  `both`, the callback is called after(!) all child nodes are visited
  ande with `whenNow` set to `after`.

- `ASTY#dump(): String`:<br/>
  Returns a textual dump of the AST starting at the current node.
